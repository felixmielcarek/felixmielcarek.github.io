        <h1>My routines</h1>
        <p>Since the Covid confinement in 2020 and the failure of my first year of university, I try to be a better man
            and not lose one second of my short and precious life. To do so, I have been inspired by <a
                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wG--G97GSRs">a video made by a
                french Youtuber Cyrus North</a> , he explains the importance that can have a good routine and what can
            it meen
            about someone.</p>

        <h2>First attempt</h2>
        <p>My first attempt to apply a routine to my life was during the second semester of my second first year in my
            computer science university. Due to the trauma from my previous year failure and my natural competitive
            caracter, my main objective was to become valedictorian. I also added to my routine different activities
            which are important to me or that I wanted to develop and removed every other activity (this include a
            complete stop of social networks). Here is what I designed:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>5 AM: Awakening</li>
            <li>5 AM - 5:15 AM: Drinking water, preparing and dressing</li>
            <li>5:15 AM - 5:45 AM: Running outside</li>
            <li>5:45 AM - 6 AM: Shower and breakfast (coffee and croque-monsieur)</li>
            <li>6 AM - 7 AM: Studying</li>
            <li>7 AM - 7:30 AM: Reading the manga My Hero Academia</li>
            <li>7:30 AM: Going to university</li>
            <li>8 AM - 5:30 PM: Studying at the university</li>
            <li>5:30 PM - 8:30 PM: Studying at the university library</li>
            <li>8:30 PM: Going back to home</li>
            <li>9 PM: Eating lunch then free time</li>
            <li>10 PM: Going to bed</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I followed this routine approximately from april 2022 to june 2022 and stopped at summer holidays beginning.
            This experience was really enriching, here are the pros and cons that I have defined:</p>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Pros</th>
                <th>Cons</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>I reached the top 10 of the promotion which allowed me to go to Canada for a study semester in 2023.
                </td>
                <td>I was so much tired at the end of the third month.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>I finished My Hero Academia mangas and even started to read scans.</td>
                <td>I lost the affinity with my friends by dint of not seeing them and not answering to messages.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>I had a great mental and body health.</td>
                <td>I lost precious moments of celebration associated with student life.</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <h2>Second attempt</h2>
        <p>This second attempt is currently in progress, after having encountered a lot of doubts in my professional and
            personal life, I wanted to try to define a new routine with the experience acquired.</p>

        <h3>Defining the context</h3>
        <p>This routine is done to dictate my life during the months of july and august 2024 where I will work in a
            company. With this context, I can start by defining 3 mandatory tasks with fixed duration per day:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Professional life: from 8 AM to 6 PM (including journeys)</li>
            <li>Sleep: 7 hours per day</li>
            <li>Hygiene tasks: includes meals, showers, teeth brushing... for 2 times 30 minutes per day</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Defining my personal development</h3>
        <p>After having defined the context, I have to choose activities that I want to work on. For each of them, I
            also defined the minimal time to do these and when I like to do them during the day.</p>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Activities</th>
                <th>Minimal duration</th>
                <th>Preferences</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Sport</td>
                <td>1 hour</td>
                <td>In the morning to awake me and not feeling the fatigue of the whole day</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Reading</td>
                <td>20 minutes</td>
                <td>Just before going to bed to help me sleep</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>3D animation</td>
                <td>1 hour</td>
                <td>I am trying to learn Blender for personal projects, it is really hard to me so I want to do it in
                    the morning to be rid of it for the day</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Films</td>
                <td>2 hours</td>
                <td>It includes movies, series episodes, Youtube videos</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Administrative tasks</td>
                <td>15 minutes</td>
                <td>It is the worst task for me but including it in my routine should help me to be more consistent</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Computer science</td>
                <td>1 hour</td>
                <td>It represents my personal computer science project</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <h3>Doing the maths</h3>
        <p>With this bunch of parameters we can begin to create the routine, first we can see if we need to have a 2 day
            alternate routine to fit every task:</p>
        <p>[24 hours in a day] - [17 hours of mandatory tasks] = [6 hours for personal development]</p>
        <p>The sum of our personal development tasks minimal durations is 5 hours 35 minutes: everything can fit in one
            day! Now lets arrange all of it:</p>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <td>0 AM - 5 AM</td>
                <td>Sleep</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>5 AM - 6 AM</td>
                <td>Sport</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>6 AM - 6:30 AM</td>
                <td>Hygiene</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>6:30 AM - 7:30 AM</td>
                <td>Blender</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>7:30 AM - 8 AM</td>
                <td>Administrative</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>8 AM - 6 PM</td>
                <td>Professional life</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>6 PM - 8 PM</td>
                <td>Films</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>8 PM - 9 PM</td>
                <td>Computer science</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>9 PM - 9:30 PM</td>
                <td>Hygiene</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>9:30 PM - 10 PM</td>
                <td>Reading</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>10 PM - 12 PM</td>
                <td>Sleep</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <h3>Days off</h3>
        <p>To prevent me from doing nothing during days off, I designed a second alternative routine for this context
            which can be way more flexible in practice. Here are the tasks included in it:</p>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Activities</th>
                <th>Preferences</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Sport</td>
                <td>In the afternoon to do it with good weather and with friends if possible</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Reading</td>
                <td>Just after awakening to have a calm nd stressless start of the day</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>3D animation</td>
                <td>No special requirements</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Films</td>
                <td>No special requirements</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Administrative tasks</td>
                <td>No special requirements</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Computer science</td>
                <td>No special requirements</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Social</td>
                <td>Time with friends or family to keep in touch with them</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <p>With these parameters I made the following routine:</p>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <td>0 AM - 8 AM</td>
                <td>Sleep</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>8 AM - 8:30 AM</td>
                <td>Reading</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>8:30 AM - 11 AM</td>
                <td>Computer science</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>11 AM - 12 AM</td>
                <td>Blender</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>12 AM - 12:30 AM</td>
                <td>Hygiene</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>12:30 AM - 2:30 PM</td>
                <td>Films</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>2:30 PM - 4 PM</td>
                <td>Blender</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>4 PM - 4:30 PM</td>
                <td>Administrative</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>4:30 PM - 6:30 PM</td>
                <td>Hygiene</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>6:30 PM - 7 PM</td>
                <td>Hygiene</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>7 PM - 12 PM</td>
                <td>Social</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
    </div>
